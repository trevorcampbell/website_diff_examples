Peng Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health 2022-01-04 The field of data science has expanded and grown significantly in recent years, attracting excitement and interest from many different directions. The demand for introductory educational materials has grown concurrently with the growth of the field itself, leading to a proliferation of textbooks, courses, blog posts, and tutorials. This book is an important contribution to this fast-growing literature, but given the wide availability of materials, a reader should be inclined to ask, “What is the unique contribution of this book?” In order to answer that question it is useful to step back for a moment and consider the development of the field of data science over the past few years. When thinking about data science, it is important to consider two questions: “What is data science?” and “How should one do data science?” The former question is under active discussion amongst a broad community of researchers and practitioners and there does not appear to be much consensus to date. However, there seems a general understanding that data science focuses on the more “active” elements—data wrangling, cleaning, and analysis—of answering questions with data. These elements are often highly problem-specific and may seem difficult to generalize across applications. Nevertheless, over time we have seen some core elements emerge that appear to repeat themselves as useful concepts across different problems. Given the lack of clear agreement over the definition of data science, there is a strong need for a book like this one to propose a vision for what the field is and what the implications are for the activities in which members of the field engage. The first important concept addressed by this book is tidy data, which is a format for tabular data formally introduced to the statistical community in a 2014 paper by Hadley Wickham. The tidy data organization strategy has proven a powerful abstract concept for conducting data analysis, in large part because of the vast toolchain implemented in the Tidyverse collection of R packages. The second key concept is the development of workflows for reproducible and auditable data analyses. Modern data analyses have only grown in complexity due to the availability of data and the ease with which we can implement complex data analysis procedures. Furthermore, these data analyses are often part of decision-making processes that may have significant impacts on people and communities. Therefore, there is a critical need to build reproducible analyses that can be studied and repeated by others in a reliable manner. Statistical methods clearly represent an important element of data science for building prediction and classification models and for making inferences about unobserved populations. Finally, because a field can succeed only if it fosters an active and collaborative community, it has become clear that being fluent in the tools of collaboration is a core element of data science. This book takes these core concepts and focuses on how one can apply them to do data science in a rigorous manner. Students who learn from this book will be well-versed in the techniques and principles behind producing reliable evidence from data. This book is centered around the use of the R programming language within the tidy data framework, and as such employs the most recent advances in data analysis coding. The use of Jupyter notebooks for exercises immediately places the student in an environment that encourages auditability and reproducibility of analyses. The integration of git and GitHub into the course is a key tool for teaching about collaboration and community, key concepts that are critical to data science. The demand for training in data science continues to increase. The availability of large quantities of data to answer a variety of questions, the computational power available to many more people than ever before, and the public awareness of the importance of data for decision-making have all contributed to the need for high-quality data science work. This book provides a sophisticated first introduction to the field of data science and provides a balanced mix of practical skills along with generalizable principles. As we continue to introduce students to data science and train them to confront an expanding array of data science problems, they will be well-served by the ideas presented here. "],["preface.html", "Preface", " Preface This textbook aims to be an approachable introduction to the world of data science. In this book, we define data science as the process of generating insight from data through reproducible and auditable processes. If you analyze some data and give your analysis to a friend or colleague, they should be able to re-run the analysis from start to finish and get the same result you did (reproducibility). They should also be able to see and understand all the steps in the analysis, as well as the history of how the analysis developed (auditability). Creating reproducible and auditable analyses allows both you and others to easily double-check and validate your work. At a high level, in this book, you will learn how to identify common problems in data science, and solve those problems with reproducible and auditable workflows. Figure 1 summarizes what you will learn in each chapter of this book. Throughout, you will learn how to use the R programming language (R Core Team 2021) to perform all the tasks associated with data analysis. You will spend the first four chapters learning how to use R to load, clean, wrangle (i.e., restructure the data into a usable format) and visualize data while answering descriptive and exploratory data analysis questions. In the next six chapters, you will learn how to answer predictive, exploratory, and inferential data analysis questions with common methods in data science, including classification, regression, clustering, and estimation. In the final chapters (??–??), you will learn how to combine R code, formatted text, and images in a single coherent document with Jupyter, use version control for collaboration, and install and configure the software needed for data science on your own computer. If you are reading this book as part of a course that you are taking, the instructor may have set up all of these tools already for you; in this case, you can continue on through the book reading the chapters in order. But if you are reading this independently, you may want to jump to these last three chapters early before going on to make sure your computer is set up in such a way that you can try out the example code that we include throughout the book. Figure 1: Where are we going? Each chapter in the book has an accompanying worksheet that provides exercises to help you practice the concepts you will learn. We strongly recommend that you work through the worksheet when you finish reading each chapter before moving on to the next chapter. All of the worksheets are available at https://worksheets.datasciencebook.ca; the “Exercises” section at the end of each chapter points you to the right worksheet for that chapter. For each worksheet, you can either launch an interactive version of the worksheet in your browser by clicking the “launch binder” button, or preview a non-interactive version of the worksheet by clicking “view worksheet.” If you instead decide to download the worksheet and run it on your own machine, make sure to follow the instructions for computer setup found in Chapter ??. This will ensure that the automated feedback and guidance that the worksheets provide will function as intended.
